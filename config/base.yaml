        # List of alarms to be ignored/filtered out from notifications
        # Each entry can specify:
        # - name: exact alarm name or pattern
        # - path: file path pattern where alarm originates
        # - environments: list of environments where rule applies (optional, defaults to all)

        # Global ignore rule: applies to all environments
        # Ignores disk space low alerts from any file
        # - name: "DiskSpaceLow"
        #   path: "file.name"
        #   reason: "Questa tipologia di errore al momento non viene considerata perché c'è un disservizio fino al 31/10"

        # Environment-templated ignore rule: applies to all environments
        # Uses [#env#] placeholder that gets replaced with actual environment name

        # Environment-specific ignore rule: applies only to specified environments
        # This rule ignores minor network flap alerts only in production
        # - name: "MinorNetworkFlap"
